## An FM synthesiser for the BBC Microcomputer based on the YM3812

This is an FM Synthesiser Sound Card for the BBC Microcomputer. It is based on the YM3812 chip as used in the Ad Lib Sound Card and the original Soundblaster. 

It connects to the 1MHz Bus and is programmed by reference to two addresses in the BBC memory map. These are `YMADDR` (&FC04) and `YMDATA` (&FC04).
