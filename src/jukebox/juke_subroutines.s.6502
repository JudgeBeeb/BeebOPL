\\prints the decimal value of A at column
\\print decimal number by converting it to BCD
\\need to understandhow this works
	TAX;				Transfer number to X
	LDA #&99;			Start with -1 in BCD form
	SED;				Switch to Decimal arithmetic
.print_dec_loop
	CLC
	ADC #1;				Add 1 with BCD arithmetic
	DEX
	BPL print_dec_loop;	Add 1 for the total in X until X<0
	CLD;				Switch back to Binary arithmetic
